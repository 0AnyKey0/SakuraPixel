## Injecting using the load script

First of all, make sure CS:GO is open, it does not matter whether you are in game or not. However, it is not recommended to inject while CS:GO is loading into a map. 

Navigate to the directory where SakuraPixel was built if you have not ready.
```bash
cd SakuraPixel
```

Now, you can inject the hack with the `load` script
```bash
./load
```

You might be prompted to enter in your password, this is because the injection script requires root access.

The text printed out during injection is not important. 

If the injection was successful you will see a message at the bottom saying `Successfully injected!`, however, if the message says `Injection failed`, then you've most likely done something wrong.

Now, go back into CS:GO, if you are in the main menu of the game you should see a banner in the top left like so:

*Note:* if you are getting crashes ( that are unrelated to game updates ) Try disabling shader precaching in your Steam Client -> Steam -> Settings -> Shader Pre-Caching. 

## Using the hack

Now that SakuraPixel has been injected into the game, press <kbd>Insert</kbd> on your keyboard to open the hack menu (<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> if you are using a laptop).

If you want to change skins or create and load configs, you can find those buttons at the top of the screen.


## Unloading the hack

If you wish to unload the hack from the game, you can do so by entering the command:
```bash
./uload
```

## Configs

Configs are stored in a hidden directory in your home folder. Specifically 
```
~/.config/SakuraPixel
```

Each `config.json` is stored in a seperately named folder (The name you see in-game, in the config window). 

To add a config, create a folder inside of the `~/.config/SakuraPixel` folder with a name of your choice, and paste the `config.json` inside of that folder.

To see hidden folders inside your home folder, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> when using a file manager.

On your command line, you can also add the -a flag on `ls` e.g.
```bash
ls -la ~/
```
